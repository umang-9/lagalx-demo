          If there is a dispute between the Parties in relation to these Terms
          and Conditions, the Parties agree to the following dispute resolution
          procedure:
        </p>

        <p>
          (a) The complainant must tell the respondent in writing, the nature of
          the dispute, what outcome the complainant wants and what action the
          complainant thinks will settle the dispute. The Parties agree to meet
          in good faith to seek to resolve the dispute by agreement between them
          (Initial Meeting).
        </p>

        <p>
          (b) If the Parties cannot agree how to resolve the dispute at the
          Initial Meeting, any Party may refer the matter to a mediator. If the
          parties cannot agree on who the mediator should be, the complainant
          will ask the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
          of the People's Republic of China to appoint a mediator. The mediator
          will decide the time and place for mediation. The Parties must attend
          the mediation in good faith, to seek to resolve the dispute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any attempts made by the Parties to resolve a dispute pursuant to this
          clause are without prejudice to other rights or entitlements of the
          Parties under these Terms and Conditions, by law or in equity.

          and Conditions cannot be interpreted as narrowly as necessary to allow
          it to be enforceable or valid, then the provision (or part of it) must
          be severed from these Terms and Conditions and the remaining
          provisions (and remaining part of the provision) of the Terms and
          Conditions are valid and enforceable.
